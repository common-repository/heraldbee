How does it work?
With Heraldbee, you can set up Google Shopping campaigns in just a few quick steps:

Don’t worry about adding information about products - Thanks to the Google API feature, Heraldbee sources all of it straight from your store's website and no manual work is necessary. 
Choose a country – Decide where would you like to advertise your products. 
Set up the budget limit and choose a payment method – This is the last decision to make before your campaign gets up and running.
After that, your campaign is ready and you can start observing the results on Heraldbee dashboard!
